Added a CSS media query which, when at very small screen sizes below 480px, sets the margin and padding of flexbox elements to 0 to prevent them from getting pushed off the page or becoming misaligned (something I didn't do in HW3). Also fixed my header navigation bar so that the “click-boxes” of each page link no longer overlap and the theme–switch button no longer becomes enlarged at small sizes. These were tiny things that bugged me when trying to navigate my page so I think these changes made it a little bit more user-friendly.
