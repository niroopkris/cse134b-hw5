Added a CSS media query which, when at very small screen sizes below 480px, sets the margin and padding of flexbox elements to 0 to prevent them from getting pushed off the page or becoming misaligned. Also fixed my header navigation bar so that the “click-boxes” of each page link no longer overlap and the theme–switch button no longer becomes enlarged at small sizes.
